SCION (Spatial Continuous IntegratiON) is a global climate-biogeochemical model that runs over geological timescales. It is a mixed dimensional system with a steady state 3D interpolated climate, 2D land surface and nondimensional ocean. It runs forwards in time and computes the Earth’s major elemental cycles and surface climate. It also predicts the values of a suite of geochemical tracers to aid in hypothesis testing.

v1.3 - October 2025

<br />

### Requires MATLAB - see package requirements below:

•	M_Map plotting package: https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~rich/map.html

•	TTCmap.m colormaps from topotoolbox: https://github.com/wschwanghart/topotoolbox/blob/master/colormaps/ttcmap.m 

<br />

### Running the model:

Calling SCION_initialise(0) runs the model and plots full output. 

Calling SCION_initialise(-1) runs model and plots only fluxes for brevity. 

<br />

### Full documentation:
For more information on model derivation and running the model, see the Guidebook in the documentation folder.

For tutorial videos see the [Earth Evolution Modelling Group code page](https://earthevolutionmodelling.com/code)

This code is free to use. The model is under continual revision/extension by my research group and collaborators. For any queries or collaboration ideas please email b.mills@leeds.ac.uk
