# SCION
## Spatial Continuous Integration - Earth Evolution Model

### Current version V1.1.4 - October 2021

SCION is a global climate-biogeochemical model that runs over geological timescales. It runs forwards in time and computes the Earth’s major elemental cycles and surface climate. It also predicts the values of a suite of geochemical tracers to aid in hypothesis testing. 

Requies MATLAB. 

For more information on running the model see the Guidebook in the documentation folder. For scientific derivaiton see the journal articles listed in the Guidebook.

This code is free to use. The model is under continual revision/extension by my research group and collaborators. For any queries or collaboration ideas please email b.mills@leeds.ac.uk
