# SCION
## Spatial Continuous Integration - Earth Evolution Model

### Current version v1.2.0 - January 2025

SCION is a global climate-biogeochemical model that runs over geological timescales. It runs forwards in time and computes the Earthâ€™s major elemental cycles and surface climate. It also predicts the values of a suite of geochemical tracers to aid in hypothesis testing. 

Requies MATLAB. 

### For more information on model derivation and running the model, see the Guidebook in the documentation folder.

This code is free to use. The model is under continual revision/extension by my research group and collaborators. For any queries or collaboration ideas please email b.mills@leeds.ac.uk or visit https://earthevolutionmodelling.com
